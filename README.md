## Tech Notes
This runs jQuery to fetch the 10,000 random magical effects from a raw JSON file in the repo itsself. Also of note, you can use a json file in a git repo as a poor-mans static API and I think that's outrageously cool.

I'm particularly proud of my commentary in the custom.js file so check that out if you want some javascript-based laughs.
